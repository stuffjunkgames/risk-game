Needed Gameplay Changes:
Prevent removing more armies than a territory started with in place phase
Finish reposition phase code
Track which armies have attacked so they cannot move multiple times in a single turn
Improve control scheme (make orders more intuitive)
Enable multiple attacks without re-clicking on territories
Change player turn at end of reposition
Implement territory bonuses
Allow for more player colors
Null player for initializing territories
Pre-game UI
Networking


Needed Graphical Changes:
Put labels and/or army-count on territories
Maybe display label when clicking territory (or hovering)
Display attacking arrow
Translucent arrows pointing to all legal attacks and then make opaque when selecting enemy territory
Change background gradients to grey
Add label for player income(# of armies gained per turn)
